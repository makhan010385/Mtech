String Interpolator
String Interpolation refers to substitution of defined variables or expressions in a given String with respected values. String Interpolation provides an easy way to process String literals. To apply this feature of Scala, we must follow few rules:
1.	String must be defined with starting character as s / f /raw.
2.	Variables in the String must have ‘$’ as prefix.
3.	Expressions must be enclosed within curly braces ({, }) and ‘$’ is added as prefix

s Interpolator: Within the String, we can access variables, object fields, functions calls, etc.
f Interpolator: This interpolation helps in formatting numbers easily.
To understand how format specifiers work refer Format Specifiers.

raw Interpolator: String Literal should start with ‘raw’. This interpolator treats escape sequences same as any other character in a String.
